# üöó Bluetooth Controlled 2-Wheel Robot Car (Tiva C Series)

A simple **Bluetooth-controlled robot car** built using the **Tiva C Series microcontroller** and a **Bluetooth module**.  
The robot moves forward, backward, left, and right based on characters (`F`, `B`, `L`, `R`) sent from a Bluetooth terminal app.

## ‚ö° Working Principle
1. The Bluetooth module receives commands from a smartphone.  
2. Tiva C reads these commands through UART.  
3. Based on the character received:
   - Drives the motors forward, backward, left, or right.  
4. Simple mapping:  

| Command | Action       |
|---------|-------------|
| F       | Forward     |
| B       | Backward    |
| L       | Left        |
| R       | Right       |
